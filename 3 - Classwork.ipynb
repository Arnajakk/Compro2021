    "- CRIM - per capita crime rate by town\n",
    "- ZN - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.\n",
    "- INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.\n",
    "- CHAS - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)\n",
    "- NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)\n",
    "- RM - average number of rooms per dwelling\n",
    "- AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940\n",
    "- DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres\n",
    "- RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways\n",
    "- TAX - full-value property-tax rate per 10,000 USD\n",
    "- PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town\n",
    "- B - 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town\n",
    "- LSTAT - %lower status of the population\n",
    "- MEDV - Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's\n",
