- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
- Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
- Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a - functional way.

### Before you start
1. There are two major versions of Python which are Python2 and Python3. Note that when you call `python` in your terminal, you are referring to Python2. Instead, you need to explicit version 3 to call to Python3 (`python3`).
2. There are different syntax between the two versions. We are recommended that you use version 3 throughout the course.
