    "1. Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,  between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "2. With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:\n",
    "\n",
    "        8\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Then, the output should be:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}\n",
    "        \n",
    "3. Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:\n",

    "    $Q = \\sqrt{(2CD)/H}$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Following are the fixed values of C and H:\n",
    "\n",
    "        C is 50. H is 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "    D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.  If the output received is in decimal form, it should be rounded off to its nearest value (for example, if the output received is 26.0, it should be printed as 26).  Example, Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program:\n",
    "\n",
    "        100,150,180\n",
    "\n",
    "    The output of the program should be:\n",

    "        18,22,24\n",
    "        \n",
    "4. With one line of code (excluding input words), write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:\n",
    "\n",
    "        hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again\n",

    "\n",
    "        1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\n",

    "    Then, the output should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1,3,5,7,9\n",

    "7. Write a program to check the validity of password.  Following are the criteria for checking the password:\n",
    "    - At least 1 letter between [a-z]\n",
    "    - At least 1 number between [0-9]\n",
    "    - At least 1 letter between [A-Z]\n",
    "    - At least 1 character from $#@\n",
    "    - Minimum length of transaction password: 6\n",
    "    - Maximum length of transaction password: 12\n",
    "\n",
    "   Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.  Example, if the following passwords are given as input to the program:\n",
    "\n",
    "        ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345\n",
    "\n",
    "    Then, the output of the program should be:\n",

    "    Hint: Uses re python module\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "8. You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, height) tuples by ascending order where name is string, age and height are numbers. The sort criteria is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Sort based on name;\n",
    "    - Then sort based on age;\n",
    "    - Then sort by score.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  The priority is that name > age > score. If the following tuples are given as input to the program:\n",
    "        \n",

    "        John,20,90\n",

    "\n",
    "    Hints:\n",
    "    Use itemgetter to enable multiple sort keys.  In addition, sorted takes a argument called key.  Thus you can do sorted(the_tuple, key = itemgetter(0,1,2)), where 0, 1, 2 corresponds to name, age, height\n",

    "9. Count frequency of word given a string assuming input uses space and sometimes comma as separator.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Define a function which can generate a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and the values are square of keys. The function should just print the values only.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hints:\n",
    "    - Use `dict[key]`=value pattern to put entry into a dictionary.\n",
    "    - Use ** operator to get power of a number.\n",
    "    - Use `range()` for loops.\n",
    "    - Use `keys()` to iterate keys in the dictionary. Also we can use item() to get key/value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Research a bit about lambda function.  Write a program which can filter even numbers in a list by using `filter()` python function. Use `lambda` function.  The list is: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].  Then, using the filtered list, use `map()` and lambda function to perform square for each number in the list\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "13.  Write a function that accepts the following arguments\n",
    "        - name, and age, where name is keyword argument with default of \"N/A\" two keyword arguments (i.e., default)\n",
    "        - list of family salary where the length is unknown (e.g., 20000, 30000, 10000).  Then length is unknown is due to the fact that we never know the size of any family ahead.  Hint: Use `*args`\n",
    "        - a dict of kids and their school name Peter = 'Saint Peter\", John = 'Pattaya International School'}.  Again, this size is unknown.  Hint: Use `*kwargs`\n",

    "\n",
