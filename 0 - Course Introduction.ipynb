    "* Room 203 also has many machine learning books I used for this class.  You are not allowed to take them away - but you are certainly welcomed to read them at my lab mini library.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For online folks, you can always schedule a zoom meeting with me by sending me emails.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Setting up your Python and Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "* I use **python3** as interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We will be using a lot of modules that may not be pre-built in python, so I assume you know how to use pip to install missing modules.   I also assume you use linux systems since I have no experience in Windows :)  Read Lab 0 if you haven't.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Highly recommend to use **venv** to setup your python environment, before installing python modules.  If you do not know how and what is venv, read this.  https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.  Docker is welcomed as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sometimes, it will take like several hours (like 3 to 4 hours) to run your model.  CSIM has some resources which you can use to help your model train faster.  One is the puffer system.  You can access it using https://puffer.cs.ait.ac.th  (in CSIM), which got four 2080Tis, 64GBs Ram, and very powerful CPU (I don't remember the series).  You must use your CSIM account to access and has been allocated a certain space amount.  Note that ~jovyan/ is all temporary, going away when the user's server is shut down. ~jovyan/work is persistent.   All notebooks are automatically stored in /work so do not worry your file will be lost.   The current server is a work-in-progress so make sure you backup!  There are also some PCs you can use at CSIM lab which has one NVIDIA 2060 super, i7, so that's plenty for you to run your model as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-requisites / Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is **NOT a sklearn/pyTorch plug-and-play course**.  I don't teach **applied stuff**...it is NOT intended to teach you to quickly get some dirty models running (you may want to try Rapidminer or PowerBI instead which is probably faster than Python; also I would recommend many nice Youtube videos out there).  Instead, this course aims for **technical** audience who would like to develop fundamental skills needed to link math, data sicence, and python seemlessly together.  There are other courses such as **Business Intelligence** that aims more toward **business** audience and focus more on using such tools.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* This is definitely not one study-and-become-expert course, but rather **prepare you to able to read research papers and translate them into Python with ease**.   Thus, everything in our course will be **coding from scratch** and **mathemtical-based**.  Of course, I will also have a self-study lecture section where I talked about sklearn/PyTorch but it's intended only for self-study, not anything I will talk about.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Math, especially knowledge in linear algebra, differential calculus, and gaussian statistics are required.  I assume that you know most of them, but I will try to be gentle in the beginning and give you guys a quick recap whenever I talk about a related math topic for the first time**. For your own deeper study, I recommend the followings:\n",
    "    - Linear Algebra short recap - https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zkolter/course/15-884/linalg-review.pdf;  Recommended book - http://linear.axler.net; Recommended playlist (Prof. Gilbert Strang) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UJ4CFRGd-U&list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8\n",
    "    - Stats - http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/ (free!)\n",
    "    \n",
    "* I have prepare some tutorials you must self-study with the beginning \"0\". Please look through them as it will be helpful to understand the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This course is best taken together with Machine Learning with Prof. Matthew Dailey, where you can study the full derivation of formulas.  We shared a lot of similarities such as regression, and classification, but with a stronger focus on the integration between mathematics and python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Very practical course.  **Intermediate level**. Could be **extremely** difficult for those without any programming experience.  Requires **huge huge amount of self-study hours**, especially if you are weak in programming/math.  I highly recommend to read the materials before you come to class; most of my students found them very helpful.  You WON'T BE GOOD if you only listen to my lecture, and don't practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What kind of *ouptput* students I want\n",
    "\n",
    "I have actually high expectations of myself to develop strong mathematical and programming skills in students.  Here are what I expect the students who finish my course will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to **code python fluently**, with good object-oriented (OO) and software engineering (SE) principles.  In a sense, students should be able to write class in a \"clean\", \"efficient\", and \"pythonic\" way.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to **self-study** advanced python stuffs in the future by increasing literacy in reading APIs, documentations, etc.  Thus, I encourage students to read APIs frequently, instead of just copying answers from StackOverflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to **read mathematics** on any given research papers without too much difficulty.  Thus I shall cover machine learning algorithms from the perspectives of mathematics, as a mean for you to get acquainted with mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to **translate those mathematical knowledge to python programming**.  Thus, our class will focus on coding from scratch, rather than using library such as sklearn or pytorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to understand what are some useful machine learning algorithms, how to implement them, and most importantly, *when* or *when NOT* to use them.  Thus I shall regularly compare and contrast different algorithms, i.e., weakness and strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to **self-explore, self-learn beyond what I teach, and link all the knowledge** you have, and combined with your own unique background (e.g., economics, medicine, finance, retail) to solve a particular data problem.  More importantly, able to *judge whether a problem is worth solving*.   Thus I shall hope that project is a good starting point.\n",
