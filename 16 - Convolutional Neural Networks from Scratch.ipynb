    "<img src =\"figures/no_padding_no_strides.gif\" width=\"150\">\n",

There is no space to convolve since the filter is 2 x 2 and it can only shift right one time.\n",

    "The answer is **padding**, where we can enlarge the input image by padding the surroundings with zeros.  How much?  Padding until we get the original size or larger size, for example, like this.  The below put **half padding** which result the output features to be the same size as input features.\n",

    "#### C. Strides\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How about the step of convolution** Should we shift 1 step per convolution, or 2 steps, or how many steps.  **In fact, it really depends on how detail you want it to be.  But defining bigger steps reduce the feature size and thus reduce the computation time.**  Bigger step is like human scanning picture more roughly but can reduce the computation time....whether to use it is something to be experimented though. \n",
    "\n",
    "In computer vision, we called this step as **stride**.  Example is like this:\n",

    "**The formula to be used to measure the padding value to get the spatial size of the input and output volume to be the same with stride 1** is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{K-1}{2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where K is the filter size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, our K has size 3 so the padding should be $(3-1)/2 = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if our image is size $24 * 24$, and the filter size is $3 x 3$, then we need to add **a border of one pixel valued 0 around the outside of the image**, which would result in the input image of size $26 * 26$\n",
    "\n",
    "In some python library such as Keras, we can set the <code>padding=same</code> to get this effect\n",
    "\n",
    "#### D. Shape of the weight matrix and output\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What should be the shape of the weight matrix or the convolutional filters and the output matrix?**.  Recall that in Dense layer, the shape of weight matrix is defined as $$neuron_{in} * neuron_{out}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given a image of 24 x 24 pixels = 576 features.  Let's say we got around 1000 images, thus our input has a shape of (1000, 576).  Thus the input layer should have 576 neurons.  Let's say our next hidden layer has 10 neurons, what should be the shape of the weight matrix?  The answer is easy, we need to simply find the ? here:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (1000, 576) @ ? = (1000, 10) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, the weight matrix would be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (576, 10) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where you can clearly see 576 is the number of input neurons and 10 is the number of output neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now our question is **how about convolutional layers**.  In convolutional layer, the shape of input has shape of (num of samples * image height * image width * num of channels).  For example, let's say after our first CNN layer, we have 1000 samples, 4 channels - edges, corners and horizontal and vertical lines, and image height and width to be 24, thus the shape of input is (1000, 24, 24, 4).  Now let's say we want to go to the next CNN layer and apply 2 filters?  What should be the shape of the weight matrix?  Also, what would be the shape of the output?  The answer is a little tough, but we know one thing is that the number of samples will remain the same, and the channel will be same as number of filters we apply, thus we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (1000, 24, 24, 4) \\circledast ? = (1000, ?, ?, 2) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The size actually depends on the stride (S), padding (P), and input size (W) with the formula as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ O = \\frac{W-F+2P}{S} + 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $O$ is the output height/length, $W$ is the input height/length, $F$ is the filter size, $P$ is the padding, and $S$ is the stride.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have an input image of size $24*24*4$, we apply 2 filters of size $3*3$, with single stride and no zero padding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here W=24, F=3, P=0 and S=1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the output volume will be $([24-3+0]/1)+1 = 22$. Therefore the output volume will be $22*22*2$.  Thus\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (1000, 24, 24, 4) \\circledast (4, 2, 3, 3)_{p=0, s=1} = (1000, 22, 22, 2) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, \n",
    "\n",
    "- The input will have a 4D shape of $(\\text{size}, \\text{image height}, \\text{image width}, \\text{input channels})$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The output will have a 4D shape of $(\\text{size}, \\text{changed image height}, \\text{changed image width}, \\text{ouput channels})$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The convolutional filters will have 4D shape of $(\\text{input channels}, \\text{filter height}, \\text{filter width}, \\text{output channels})$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: The order does not matter and it depends on the python library you use but these four dimensions always exist in CNN.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The general rule of selecting padding, stride and filter size are of course of trial-and-error.  But it's important to remember that they should result in output image size of integers not decimals\"\n",

    "### 2. Max/Average Pooling Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Talking about **reducing computation time**, another way is to perform a **pooling layer** which simply downsample the image by average a set of pixels, or by taking the maximum value.  If we define a pooling size of 2, this involves mapping each 2 x 2 pixels to one output, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src =\"figures/pooling.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, pooling has a really big downsides, i.e., it basically lose a lot of information.  Compared to strides, strides simply scan less but maintain the same resolution but pooling simply reduce the resolution of the images....As Geoffrey Hinton said on Reddit AMA in 2014 - **The pooling operation used in CNN is a big mistake and the fact that it works so well is a disaster**.  In fact, in most recent CNN architectures like ResNets, it uses pooling very minimially or not at all.  In this lecture, we are not going to implement pooling, but we just talk about it for the sake of completeness since very early architectures like AlexNet uses pooling\n",

Padding until we get the original size or larger size, for example, like this.  The below put **half padding** which result the output features to be the same size as input features.\n",

    "For example, given a image of 24 x 24 pixels = 576 features.  Let's say we got around 1000 images, thus our input has a shape of (1000, 576).  Thus the input layer should have 576 neurons.  Let's say our next hidden layer has 10 neurons, what should be the shape of the weight matrix?  The answer is easy, we need to simply find the ? here:\n",

    "Now our question is **how about convolutional layers**.  In convolutional layer, the shape of input has shape of (num of samples * image height * image width * num of channels).  For example, let's say after our first CNN layer, we have 1000 samples, 4 channels - edges, corners and horizontal and vertical lines, and image height and width to be 24, thus the shape of input is (1000, 24, 24, 4).  Now let's say we want to go to the next CNN layer and apply 2 filters?  What should be the shape of the weight matrix?  Also, what would be the shape of the output?  The answer is a little tough, but we know one thing is that the number of samples will remain the same, and the channel will be same as number of filters we apply, thus we get:\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ O = \\frac{W-F+2P}{S} + 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $O$ is the output height/length, $W$ is the input height/length, $F$ is the filter size, $P$ is the padding, and $S$ is the stride.\n",

    "### 2. Max/Average Pooling Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Talking about **reducing computation time**, another way is to perform a **pooling layer** which simply downsample the image by average a set of pixels, or by taking the maximum value.  If we define a pooling size of 2, this involves mapping each 2 x 2 pixels to one output, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src =\"figures/pooling.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, pooling has a really big downsides, i.e., it basically lose a lot of information.  Compared to strides, strides simply scan less but maintain the same resolution but pooling simply reduce the resolution of the images....As Geoffrey Hinton said on Reddit AMA in 2014 - **The pooling operation used in CNN is a big mistake and the fact that it works so well is a disaster**.  In fact, in most recent CNN architectures like ResNets, it uses pooling very minimially or not at all.  In this lecture, we are not going to implement pooling, but we just talk about it for the sake of completeness since very early architectures like AlexNet uses pooling\n",

    "### 3. Flatten Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "It must be said that in CNN, probably there are many convolutional layers.  However, in the last layer, typically, if we want to predict a certain class, it make sense to use Dense layer as the output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the question is how do we send input of shape $(\\text{size}, \\text{image height}, \\text{image width}, \\text{input channels})$ into Dense layer?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is actually quite easy.  What we can do is simply squash all these 4D vectors into 2D vectors.  For example, given (1000, 22, 22, 2), through a *flatten* operation, the vector becomes (1000, 968), which we can then multiply with weight just like in Dense layer, make predictions, and calculate loss just like we did in previous class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why we can perform *flatten* operation?  Does it not lost any information?  This is because through flattening, the information is not lost...in fact, it is just another representations, thus flattening does not result in any loss of information.  It also allow the Dense layer to understand the relationships of visual patterns from prior convolutional layers to the output.\n",
