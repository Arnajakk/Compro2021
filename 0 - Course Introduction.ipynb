    "* My name is Chaklam.  Born Hong Kong.  Research Interests on Neurosciene, Brain Computer Interfaces, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Human Computer Interaction.  Welcome you all!  This course will be fun and tough!\n",
    "\n",
    "* All materials can be found on my **Github - https://github.com/chaklam-silpasuwanchai/**.  If you forget, you can also get the link from http://chaklam.com\n",
    "\n",
    "* I am sitting in either room **101** or **203** most of the time.  You are very welcomed to meet me in person.  In fact, I want anyone of you to visit me and ask question, instead of just feeling stressed.  There is no need of appointment - but if you need like 3 hours of talk, you can send emails to my calendar - chaklam@ait.asia\n",
    "\n",
    "* Room 203 also has many machine learning books I used for this class.  You are not allowed to take them away - but you are certainly welcomed to read them at my lab mini library.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For online folks, you can always schedule a zoom meeting with me by sending me emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Introducing our TA, Mr. Akrardet (Jo) - st121413@ait.asia  PhD. students in my lab working on brain computer interfaces.  He will be in charge of\n",
    "  - Google classroom (code: will be provided by Jo)\n",
    "  - Checking assignments\n",
    "  - Uploading our lecture video to some repository\n",
    "  - Organizing quiz\n",
    "  - Troubleshoot any of your problems during class (but please be gentle to him!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up your Python and Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "* I use **python3** as interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We will be using a lot of modules that may not be pre-built in python, so I assume you know how to use pip to install missing modules.   I also assume you use linux systems since I have no experience in Windows :)  Read Lab 0 if you haven't.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Highly recommend to use **venv** to setup your python environment, before installing python modules.  If you do not know how and what is venv, read this.  https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.  Docker is welcomed as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sometimes, it will take like several hours (like 3 to 4 hours) to run your model.  CSIM has some resources which you can use to help your model train faster.  One is the puffer system.  You can access it using https://puffer.cs.ait.ac.th  (in CSIM), which got four 2080Tis, 64GBs Ram, and very powerful CPU (I don't remember the series).  You must use your CSIM account to access and has been allocated a certain space amount.  Note that ~jovyan/ is all temporary, going away when the user's server is shut down. ~jovyan/work is persistent.   All notebooks are automatically stored in /work so do not worry your file will be lost.   The current server is a work-in-progress so make sure you backup!  There are also some PCs you can use at CSIM lab which has one NVIDIA 2060 super, i7, so that's plenty for you to run your model as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-requisites / Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Math, especially knowledge in linear algebra, differential calculus, and gaussian statistics are required.  I assume that you know most of them, but I will try to be gentle in the beginning and give you guys a quick recap whenever I talk about a related math topic for the first time**. For your own deeper study, I recommend the followings:\n",
    "    - Linear Algebra short recap - https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zkolter/course/15-884/linalg-review.pdf;  Recommended book - http://linear.axler.net; Recommended playlist (Prof. Gilbert Strang) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UJ4CFRGd-U&list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8\n",
    "    - Stats - http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/ (free!)\n",
    "\n",
    "* This course is best taken together with Machine Learning with Prof. Matthew Dailey, where you can study the full derivation of formulas.  We shared a lot of similarities such as regression, and classification, but with a stronger focus on the integration between mathematics and python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Very practical course.  **Intermediate level**. Could be slightly difficult for those without any programming experience, but I will try my best to explain almost everything slowly and clearly as possible.  I will work very hard and I also hope the same for your side. **I shall have interactive python session for the first four topics on Python, Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib, in which I will code interactively with you; once you are more familiar with Python, I shall only demonstrate the code from a review perspective from regression topic onward**\n",
    "\n",
    "* We shall mostly focus on **coding from scratch**, instead of using ready-module such as sklearn.  This shall be useful to understand the internal workings of machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Requires **huge amount of self-study hours**, especially if you are weak in programming/math.  I highly recommend to read the materials before you come to class; most of my students found them very helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What kind of ouptput students I want\n",
    "\n",
    "I have actually high expectations of myself to develop strong mathematical and programming skills in students.  Here are what I expect the students who finish my course will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to code python fluently, with good object-oriented (OO) and software engineering (SE) principles.  In a sense, students should be able to write class in a \"clean\", \"efficient\", and \"pythonic\" way.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to *self-study* advanced python stuffs in the future by increasing literacy in reading APIs, documentations, etc.  Thus, I encourage students to read APIs frequently, instead of just copying answers from Stackoverflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to read mathematics on any given research papers without too much difficulty.  Thus I shall cover machine learning algorithms from the perspectives of mathematics as well, as a mean for you to get acquainted with mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to translate those mathematical knowledge to python programming.  Thus, our class will focus on coding from scratch, rather than using library such as sklearn or pytorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to understand what are some useful machine learning algorithms, how to implement them, and most importantly, *when* or *when NOT* to use them.  Thus I shall regularly compare and contrast different algorithms, i.e., weakness and strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to link all the knowledge you have, and combined with your own unique background (e.g., economics, medicine, finance, retail) to solve a particular data problem.  More importantly, able to *judge whether a problem is worth solving*.   Thus I shall hope that project is a good starting point.\n",
