    "In the last two classes, we focus on understanding deep neural net and I hope it's going fantastic.  Anyhow, what we have been discovering so far is the most basic form of it and most of the time, it is insufficient for most real-world problems.  \n",

    "\n",
    "In a high-level view, we can say that Neural Network is trying to most optimal parameters which is commonly defined as W that **minimizes the loss**, which can be described using the figure like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we use non-linear activation function like sigmoid, **each W will have a non-linear relationship with the loss**.  If we plot one W against loss, while keeping everything constant, we get this oversimplistic graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/4-2.png\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning, we will probably randomize a W value, and **we iterate to update our W by finding the gradients**.  How large should we move along the slope then?  We use **learning rate**.  Small learning rate means small step of update which can be slow but risk ending up in a **local minimia**, while large learning mean large step of update what will be faster but risk **hopping over\"** the global minimum\n",
