    "* My name is Chaklam.  Hong Kong born.  Can understand Thai but can't read so don't write Thai emails!  Ph.D. on Human Computer Interaction.  Research Interests on Brain Computer Interfaces.  Welcome you all!  This course will be fun and tough!\n",
    "\n",
    "* All materials can be found on my **Github - https://github.com/chaklam-silpasuwanchai/**.  If you forget, you can also get the link from http://chaklam.com\n",
    "\n",
    "* I am sitting in **room 203** most of the time.  You are very welcomed to meet me in person.  In fact, I want anyone of you to visit me and ask question, instead of just feeling stressed.  There is no need of appointment - but if you need like 3 hours of talk, you can send emails to my calendar - chaklam@ait.asia\n",
    "\n",
    "* Room 203 also has many machine learning books I used for this class.  You are not allowed to take them away - but you are certainly welcomed to read them at my lab mini library.\n",

    "### Setting up your Python and Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "* I use **python3** as interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We will be using a lot of modules that may not be pre-built in python, so I assume you know how to use pip to install missing modules.   I also assume you use linux systems since I have no experience in Windows :)  Read Lab 0 if you haven't.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Highly recommend to use **venv** to setup your python environment, before installing python modules.  If you do not know how and what is venv, read this.  https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.  Docker is welcomed as well.\n",

    "### Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Math is not required and will be taught just enough for you to code your own SVM, etc.** I will be providing 9 hours related to Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Stats. This course is best taken together with Machine Learning with Prof. Matthew Dailey, where you can study the full derivation of formulas.  For your own deeper study, I recommend the followings:\n",
    "    - Linear Algebra short recap - https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zkolter/course/15-884/linalg-review.pdf;  Recommended book - http://linear.axler.net; Recommended playlist (Prof. Gilbert Strang) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UJ4CFRGd-U&list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8\n",
    "    - Stats - http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/ (free!)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Very practical course.  **Intermediate level**. Could be slightly difficult for those without any programming experience, but I will try my best to explain almost everything slowly and clearly as possible.  I will work very hard and I also hope the same for your side.\n",
