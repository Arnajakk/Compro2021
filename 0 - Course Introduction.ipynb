    "* **Math is not required and will be taught just enough for you to code your own SVM, etc.** I will be providing 9 hours related to Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Stats. This course is best taken together with Machine Learning with Prof. Matthew Dailey, where you can study the full derivation of formulas.  For your own deeper study, I recommend the followings:\n",
